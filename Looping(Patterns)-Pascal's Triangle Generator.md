# ðŸ”º Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. 2.	Read integer â€˜aâ€™ from user. 
3.	Outer loop 
      1.	Loop over i from 0 to a-1 (each row in Pascal's Triangle). 
4.	Inner Loop 
      1.	For each row i, print (a-i-1) spaces to align the numbers correctly. 
5.	Inner Loop(Binomial coefficients): 
      1.	For each row i, loop over j from 0 to i (this will print the elements of the row). 
      2.	For each j, calculate the Binomial coefficient using math package: i!//j!*(iâˆ’j)! 
      3.	Print the Binomial Coefficient without a newline (use end=" "). 
6.	Print new line
7.	End

## ðŸ§ª Program
```
from math import factorial 
a=int(input())
for i in range(a):
    for j in range (a-i-1): 
        print(end=" ")
for j in range(i+1): 
        print(factorial(i)//(factorial(j)*factorial(i-j)),end=" ")
print() 
```

## Result
Thus, the python program to print Pascal triangle is created successfully.
